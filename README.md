# About SOURCE ONE X8 LIFTER
## The idea
The SOURCE ONE X8 LIFTER is based on the popular SOURCE ONE V4 frame by Team BlackSheep. The SOURCE ONE X8 uses the TBS SOURCE ONE V4 and only the arms were redesigned to hold eight motors. Two new arms were designed plus a cover. One motor gets mounted to the arm and one to the cover. The cover gets then mounted to the arm.
